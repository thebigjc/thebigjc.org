After a few years, I've decided to resurrect the [old domain name][thebigjc] again. I lost it for a few years in there as I was using [DynDns][dyndns] to manage the name and never received the expiry notice (note to self: do not have the ownership for a domain go to an email at that domain). A squatter picked it up for a couple of years, and I didn't bother to get it back.

A few months ago I put in a 'backorder' with [GoDaddy][godaddy], and as soon as it expired, they pounced on it. Cheesy commercials and horrible UI not withstanding, they do a good job on the technical end of things. I've heard people complaining about how they are getting expensive, but for $20, they got it done.

I also wanted to setup a blog. Rather than trying to actually run a server and maintain it, I'm letting the folks at [Amazon][amazon] and [Github][github] do that for me. I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] as the blog engine (starting with a very frill-free theme), and I'm [blogging like a hacker][hacker], writting posts in [MacVim][macvim], storing the content in a [github repo][ghthebigjc] and deploying using [s3cmd][] to S3.

So far so good. Thinking about what I want to do for comments - might just drop a Facebook widget in there. People are mentioning disquis as the normal way to add comments to jekyll, but I don't really see the appeal.

Anyways - back on the horse. 'til next time.
